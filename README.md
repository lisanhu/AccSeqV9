# Temporary README for AccSeqV9

## What is this repo about

AccSeqV9 is a DNA sequence alignment tool which uses our novel seeding, exact string matching algorithm, and a new sequence alignment algorithm GACT (GACT is built according to papers from Darwin, which is using FPGA) algorithm to help with faster DNA sequencing. This repo contains a working version for single end DNA reads sequencing.

## Next Steps

- Accelerate the code using OpenACC to support GPU and other accelerators
- Run experiments and tune parameters to achieve better performance (processing time, accuracy and sensitivity metrics )
